# About Me

Hello!

My name is Markus, zero9178 on the internet, and I am currently a Bachelor student at the Technical University of 
Vienna.
In 2019, I started heavily getting into compilers which has lead to me creating a variety of compiler-related projects.
Check them out [here](projects_page)!

In 2020 I became a regular contributor to the [LLVM Project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project), initially 
contributing to the Windows support in Clang and LLD.
In 2021 I learned about MLIR and became a heavy user and regular contributor to the project.
In 2023 I was awarded the [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/05/google-open-source-peer-bonus-program-announces-first-group-of-winners-2023.html)
for my contributions to MLIR.
